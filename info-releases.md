| DSP v45 | To be rolled out on UAT on Friday (5th May). To be deployed on PROD on Tuesday (9th May).  |
| DSX v86 | Immediately after Go/NoGO meet on 4th May (BZT/DEP Replacement), the plan is to rollout v86 on UAT. The target date for release is Thursday, 11th May. The regression tests should be completed by 11th May EOD so that deployment can be carried out in the late evening.|
|Highlighted Risks|DEP/BZT Replacement - The regression tests are ongoing. If there are any serious bugs, they may not be fixed by EOD on Thursday, 4th May. The PROD deployment plan is too tight.|
|⬆️|DSX v86 - There is a Public Holiday on 8th May and  a Local Holiday on 10th May. This might cause delay in the v86 regression tests and in turn impact the PROD delivery on 11th May.
|⬆️|Decision Making - The POs, Phillip Harrison, Sreeharsha Ananda Rao need to agree on a Plan B of moving the releases by a week in case any of the above two risks are realized.|
